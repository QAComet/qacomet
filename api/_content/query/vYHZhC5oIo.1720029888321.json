Some constraints to consider are understanding your customer's technical abilities, their patience with new tech, tolerance for bugs or broken workflows, ability to handle product changes, or even their external constraints. You may be building products used by workers at 3 AM in the morning. If they didn't get the sleep they needed before their night shift it's your obligation to ensure they can't easily fail while using your product.

Any extra page or click you can shave off a workflow has tremendous benefits. Not only will customers experience less friction using your product, but now you will have less complexity to deal with. This can reduce bug-surface area and lead to faster development time. Better usability leads to better workflows, happier customers, and more referrals for growing your customer base."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"order-usability-report","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"measuring-your-performance"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Measuring your performance"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the most common ways to measure your product's performance amongst customers is to measure your Net Promotor Score (NPS) "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#references"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"[Nielsen Norman]"}]},{"type":"text","value":". Calculating this starts by surveying customers to rate on a 0-10 scale how likely they will recommend your product to a friend or their company. Then you take their ratings and put them into two buckets. The first is the number of promoters and the second is the number of detractors. A promoter is someone who rates 9 or 10, and a detractor is someone who rates their likelihood somewhere between 0-6.
