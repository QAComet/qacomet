At the start of your product development cycle, you would have an idea and let your designers mock up a solution. This would be sent to your developers to code and once the feature was shaping up and looking close to release, you would now have your QA team work on these updates and find any problems with it. Now, if you have a general workflow bug that needs to be resolved at the design stage, you're going to have to make changes all along the product development cycle. Your designers will need to fix their mockups, then developers will need to change their code to conform to these changes. At this point, there's increased pressure to release so it's more likely your developers will introduce new bugs from migrating their old code to the new changes."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"QA in waterfall managed projects","src":"/img/blog/shifting-left/old_diagram.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"All this back and forth from QA to the beginning of the product development cycle means more development time, changing requirements, and a slower release process.

Additionally, your software development team benefits because the QA team has the requirements from the planning and design stages, and they can start writing automated tests. With this workflow, you can now have your developers and QA working synchronously. Not only that, QA can now find implementation bugs even before the developers have finished writing all of their code because of the early development of automated tests. If you have a test automation suite integrated into a continuous integration system, your developers can automatically test their code and catch bugs while implementing the product. This lets developers catch bugs earlier on in the development process and helps your company launch a more robust product because of increased test coverage earlier on in the SDLC."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"how-shifting-left-helps-your-startup-innovate"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How \"Shifting-Left\" helps your startup innovate"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Now that we have an in-depth understanding of \"Shift-Left\" QA, let's speak more about the benefits.

Another benefit of having your QA team work with your developers is they can collaborate on finer-grained edge cases. Maybe your developers spot some edge cases that should be automatically tested to ensure future changes don't break the product that is most clear if you're working on the product's code.
